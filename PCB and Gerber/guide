# Kiki v1: Ordering & Assembly 🔌

The Kiki v1 is designed for easy assembly using **NextPCB**. The processor and tiny components are integrated directly onto the board, so you don't need to solder the "brains" of the keyboard yourself.

## How to Order
To get the best results, follow these steps on the NextPCB website:

1. **Upload Gerbers**: Upload the `Gerber.zip` file found in the `/Hardware` folder.
2. **PCBA Service**: Select the "PCB Assembly" option.
3. **Upload Assembly Files**: 
   - Use `BOM.csv` (Bill of Materials) so they know which parts to use.
   - Use `CPL.csv` (Component Placement List) so they know where to put them.
4. **Result**: You will receive a board that already has the RP2040 chip, diodes, and resistors pre-installed.

## Final Assembly (Your Part)
Once the boards arrive, you only need to solder the larger "human-sized" parts:
* **Switch Sockets**: For hot-swapping your switches.
* **Rotary Encoders**: Two on each side.
* **OLED Screens**: For the Bongo Cat animations.
* **TRRS Jacks**: To connect the two halves using a standard TRRS cable.
